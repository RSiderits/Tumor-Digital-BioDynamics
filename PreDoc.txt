# Notes: -------------------------------------------------------
    
    # Human diploid cell in G1 has about 6 picograms of DNA
    
    # Nuclear DNA Content Varies with Cell Size across Human Cell Types
          
    # Non-tumor cellularity is epithelial, mesenchymal, immune, endothelial, fribrblast)
    
    # TIS = Tumor Induced Stroma (Tumor microenvironment)
    
    # TCF = Tumor Cell Fields

    # IBTC = In Between Tumor Cells

    # PNT = Parenchyma Non-Tumor

    # TAS = Tumor Associated Stroma (reparative)
    
    
 # Assumptions: ------------------------------------------------------------ @
     
    # The tumor is roughly sherical.
    # Sections at equitorial plane of section (standard grossing practice) 
    # Picograms DNA are from Enhanced for tumor samples (stroma rmoved)
    # Count necrosis as stromal for estimates of non-tumor
    # Average cell has about 6 pg DNA
    # Non-tumor cellularity is epithelial, mesenchymal, immune, endothelial, fribrblast)
    # "Enhanced for tumor" follows microdissection, non-tumor stroma is excised from block
    # Extraction efficiency and proportion of Tumor Induced Stroma (TIS) vary.
    # Necrosis in Tumor Cell Field (TCF), should be counted as non-tumor.
    
# Instructions: ------------------------------------------------------------ @
        
    #     1) Review tissue in H&E or Hematoxolyn stained sections.
    #     2) Estimate:
    #         - Average diameter of the lesion or TCF if using a core
    #         - Average size of the tumor cells in um, measure up o 20 cells.
    #         - Percent TIS
    #         - Cellularity of TIS, include areas of necrosis
    #     3) If you are using a core, then use the core diameter as the leasion size
    #     4) Enter variables into the respective fields then click "calculate"

    # The final field will provide an estmated number of 10um thick secton to assure 100ng of Tumor DNA
